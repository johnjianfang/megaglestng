a => rotate camera left (only in free camera more)
d => rotate camera right (only in free camera more)
g => center camera on selection
space => reset camera to default position
up arrow or mouse on top => move camera forward
down arrow or mouse on bottom => move camera backward
left arrow or mouse on left => move camera left
right arrow or mouse on right => move camera right

b) Orders and Unit selection

left mouse button => select or deselect units
shift + left mouse button => add unit to selection
control + left mouse button => remove unit from selection
left mouse double click => select nearby units of this type
right mouse button => auto order
menu click => activate order
left mouse when order is activated => give order
right mouse when order is activated => cancel state

control + number => assign group

c) Network

enter => start typing/send chat message
h => toggle between 'All' and 'Team' chat modes
n => show network status

d) Hotkeys (only in game camera more)

a => activate attack command for selection 
s => issue stop command to selection
i => select next idle harvester
b => select next building
d => select next damaged unit
t => select next storage unit
r => rotate building before placement


e) Other Keys

- + => adjust game speed  (disabled in multiplayer)
p => pause game (disabled in multiplayer)
e => save screen to TGA file
c => toggle ingame font color ( and font shadow )
m => show faded mesages again
? => Toggle display of Debug information when DebugMode=true
/ => Toggle display of mouse pointer from Operating System to Glest Rendered


CONFIGURATION
==============

Glest can be configured in three ways:
- in-game config menu: basic parameters
- configuration tool: advanced parameters
- glest.ini: all parameters
- glestkeys.ini: all hotkeys

DO NOT directly edit the ini files but rather for user
changes edit glestuser.ini and glestuserkeys.ini and create 
the over-ride values that you desire.


NETWORK PLAY
=============

To start a network game, one of the players has to create a new game with network slots and the other players have to join.

The best place to find people to play a multiplayer game is a) using the Internet Game menu, 
b) in the Glest forums or c) irc channel (see "about" section).

To connect to a server you need the server's IP, the IP is shown at the top of the "custom game" menu. 
This is the right IP for LAN play, however if you are under router and you want to play over the internet, 
you will need the IP of the router. Once you have connected to a server once, the game will remember it, and 
you can select it from the server list, in the "join game" menu.

For LAN play, clients may click the 'find LAN games' menu item to find servers with an Open Network slot
on the local Network. (this uses UDP Broadcast)

For Internet play there is an Internet Game menu item which allows Clients to 
find published servers and players who wish to host internet games (Servers) 
may 'publish' their game to the masterserver via the 'Publish To master' option
in the Custom Game menu.

Glest uses TCP port 61357, if you are behind a router you will have to forward 
this port to your computer if you want to host games. This port may be changed
via glestuser.ini.

All players have to be using the same binaries of the game and have exactly 
the same map, tileset and tech tree. This means that if you have mods installed
in the tech tree that is being used for the game, every player has to have the 
same mods. An option if you want to install mods over the magitech tech tree and 
be able to play people that don't have them, is to copy it and install the mods 
over the copy.

You can disable binary and checksum checks in glest.ini, by setting 
NetworkConsistencyChecks to 0, but the game might get out of sync and crash.


COMMAND LINE
=============

glest => start game normally
glest --version => display the version string
glest -server => start game in the new game screen with all slots open
glest -client ServerIp => start game connecting to a server


VIDEO CARD HINTS
=================

Auto config.

The first time you run the game it will try to detect the graphic settings most 
suitable for your video card. It's highly recommended that you don't change 
them unless you really know what you are doing. If you change the settings and 
you want to reset to the recommended ones, you can do it by using the auto config 
button in the in-game options menu.


Required card features.

The game requires either OpenGL 1.4 or OpenGL 1.3 plus the GL_ARB_env_crossbar 
extension. Most video cards with recent drivers support this features. You can 
bypass the feature check by replacing the "CheckGlCaps=1" line in glest.ini by 
"CheckGlCaps=0", but the game may crash or have graphics errors.

ATI card problems.

In some versions of the Catalyst drivers, OpenGL selection mode is implemented 
by software, making it incredibly slow. Glest uses selection mode to select units 
using the mouse (and in versions prior to 3.1.2 to place buildings too), so 
selecting units makes the frame rate drop quite a lot, not to the point of 
making the game unlayable if you have a fast computer, but it is a very 
noticeable glitch. To fix this you can revert the video card drivers to 
Catalyst 7.9 or earlier. There are some more tricky things you can to if you 
want to keep your current driver version, please see our boards for more information.

Also, there seems to be a bug in some ATI OpenGL drivers that makes the game 
crash with certain card/driver configurations when using more than 1 light. 
Auto config  will detect this issue and turn off all secondary lights when it 
detects an ATI card. If you still want to try running the game using more 
than 1 light you can change this setting in the in-game options menu.

Shadows.

The game features real-time shadows using different algorithms. 
1) Projected: Fast shadows but they provide unit over terrain shadows only, 
and can produce incorrect shadows in some circumstances. 

2) Shadow mapping: Slow shadows but they are always correct and provide 
everything over everything shadows. In ATI cards they look aliased. Both 
types of shadows require a video card with 3 texture unit support. Auto config
 will set the most suitable shadow mode for your video card.

3D textures

The game uses 3D textures for some effects like animated water. Some old video
cards (ie: GeForceMX) don't support this feature by hardware and the game runs 
really slow when the camera is near a river.  Auto config will detect this and 
disable 3D textures when needed.
